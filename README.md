Objective:
The objective is to build an application to compare the efficiency of different sorting algorithms. The 
application should be able to compare the efficiency of sorting algorithms with their respective 
asymptotic behavior.
Requirements:
1- Ability to create test data files. Optionally test data files may be created using Microsoft Excel.
2- The user can choose either to compare the efficiency of an algorithm with another algorithm, or 
to compare an algorithm with its asymptotic efficiency.
3- Ability to select an algorithm out of predefined set of algorithms. A list of sort algorithm must 
include, but not limited to, the insertion sort, the merge sort, the bubble sort, the quick sort, 
and the heap sort.
4- Efficiency should be measured as the number of steps taken by the algorithm to sort the test 
data.
5- The results should be displayed graphically.
Deliverables:
At the 14
th week the final version of the algorithm after implementing the full set of algorithms
